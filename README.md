## Introduction

This repository has been submitted alongside the final report for the dissertation module TECH7009.

## Requirements

The project utilises the following additional python libraries and modules:

* keras
* sklearn
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib

## How to use this project

There are six python files that make up the final project; these are all distinguishable through the prefix at the start of the file names begining with "final".

* final-file.py
  * This file contains the pre-processing and chi-squared analysis functions which are utilised by the ML models.
* final-linear.py
  * Run this file to produce the linear model for all variations of the dataset
* final-svm.py
  * Run this file to produce the SVM model for all variations of the dataset, as well as the hyperparamter tuning
* final-rf.py
  * Run this file to produce the RF model for all variations of the dataset, as well as the hyperparamter tuning
* final-nn1.py
  * Run this file to produce the first ANN model for all variations of the dataset
* final-nn2.py
  * Run this file to produce the second ANN model for all variations of the dataset
